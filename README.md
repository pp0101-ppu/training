🔍 Project Summary
This project demonstrates basic ethical hacking by simulating attacks on a vulnerable system (Metasploitable) using Kali Linux. It involves scanning, exploitation, and remediation techniques.

🧰 Tools Used
🛰️ Nmap – Port and service scanning

💣 Metasploit – Exploiting known vulnerabilities

🔐 John the Ripper – Password hash cracking

⚠️ Key Vulnerabilities
vsftpd 2.3.4 – Backdoor access (CVE-2011-2523) → 🔄 Update to 3.0.5

Samba 3.0.20 – Remote code execution → 🔄 Upgrade to 4.20.1

R Services – Insecure legacy access → ❌ Disable and use SSH

✅ What I Learned
How to perform basic penetration testing

Importance of secure configurations

Hands-on use of Linux security tools

Identifying and fixing real vulnerabilities
